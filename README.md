# react_with_max-error_messaging
This simple app focuses on React fundamentals and error handling.  
Concepts explored:
- CSS modules - CSS files in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.

- Ternary operator - The name ternary refers to the fact that the operator takes three operands. The condition is a boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false.

- Passing functions between components

- Lifting State up - bubbling State upwards to the closest ancestor of components that need it.  

- Creating Helper wrapping elements

- props.children - a special prop, automatically passed to every component, that can be used to render the content included between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component

- Creating error messaging

- Modal creation

- React fragments - A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM

- ReactDOM.createPortal() - rendered html content is moved somewhere else.
